Venue

The [Pierce's Inn][] is located in Etna, NH. There is lodging capacity
for up to 40 guests and ample work space. Hiking trails are located
nearby and there is a large lawn to throw a frisbee, play croquet, or
kick a soccer ball around. There is a drum set and piano on the
premises. We are encouraged to invite guests to bring their instruments
and play music. The living room and dining room are large and
comfortable. Meals are home-cooked and will include options for persons
with any dietary restrictions. The Inn has arranged discounted perperson
rates for overnight and day guests.

Details
-------

Participants will be asked to arrive at the Inn between 3 and 4 PM on
Friday, September 27. We will provide a shuttle from Hanover to the Inn
shortly after the coaches arrive from New York and Boston. At 4 PM, we
will lead an introductory welcome talk, followed by a short keynote
talk. Afterwards participants will have an opportunity to present their
hacking ideas and recruit team members. Hacking begins after dinner. A
social hour will ensue at 11 PM, accompanied by impromptu music playing.

The bulk of the hacking will occur on Saturday. We will arrange one or
two voluntary guided hikes with the innkeepers. These hikes will allow
participants to clear their heads and discuss their ideas outdoors in a
nontraditional setting. Another social hour will wrap up Saturday
evening.

Participants will be encouraged to spend Sunday morning
documenting their work on an event wiki. Each group will present their
work before lunch. During lunch participants will vote on awards. The
award ceremony will occur after lunch. Participants will vacate the Inn
by 3 PM.
