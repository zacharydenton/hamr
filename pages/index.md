About
-----
**Music hackathons** offer the means to collaborate intensively on music-related software and hardware research projects. Their effectiveness is fostered by the opportunity to forge new relationships and explore creative hacking ideas.

Columbia University's [LabROSA] recently held a music hackathon having an emphasis on musical audio analysis, processing, and synthesis. The event, called Hacking Audio and Music Research (HAMR), further underscored academic research, good documentation, and open-sourced code. Columbia's HAMR was a resounding success and we at Dartmouth College would like to carry the torch.

Highlights
-----
-   Arrive in Hanover, NH **Friday September 27**, depart **Sunday
    September 29**
-   The hackathon will take place at [a quaint rural inn][Pierce's Inn] during the
    height of New England's fall foliage
-   The event (including 6 meals and lodging for up to 40 participants) is
    sponsored by Dartmouth College's [Neukom Institute] and the [Bregman Music and Audio Research Studio]
-   We seek equal participation from **undergraduate** and **graduate students**
-   Hackers will be able to work at the venue **without interruption**
    through the weekend
-   **Voluntary guided hikes** and other outdoor activities will be arranged
    to break up the hacking

### Schedule
Participants are asked to arrive at the Inn between 3 and 4 PM on
Friday, September 27. At 4 PM, we
will lead an introductory welcome talk, followed by a short keynote
talk. Afterwards participants will have an opportunity to present their
hacking ideas and recruit team members. Hacking begins after dinner. A
social hour will ensue at 11 PM, accompanied by impromptu music playing (possibly by a fire pit!).

The bulk of the hacking will occur on Saturday. We will arrange one or
two voluntary guided hikes with the innkeepers. These hikes will allow
us to clear our heads and discuss our ideas outdoors in a
nontraditional setting. Another social hour will wrap up Saturday
evening.

Participants will be encouraged to spend Sunday morning
documenting their work on the [wiki]. Each group will present their
final hack before lunch. During lunch participants will vote on awards. The
award ceremony will occur after lunch. Participants will vacate the Inn
by 3 PM.

### Venue
The [Pierce's Inn][] is located in Etna, NH. There is lodging capacity
for up to 40 guests and ample work space. Six meals will be provided. (Dietary constraints can be given at the registration site.) Hiking trails are located
nearby and there is a large lawn to throw a frisbee, play croquet, or
kick a soccer ball around. There is a drum set and piano on the
premises. We encourage guests to **bring their instruments**.

### Travel
The [Dartmouth Coach] has daily busses to/from New York and Boston. We have arranged the hackathon schedule so that it begins shortly after the first bus from NY arrives on Friday and ends shortly before the last bus to NY departs on Sunday. The Dartmouth Coach to/from New York requires reservations. We suggest that tickets are booked early (they may be cancelled up to a day before travel).

We will provide shuttles or some other means of transportation to/from the Dartmouth Coach bus stop and Pierce's Inn.

Other travel options include Amtrak (beware: the schedule is not very reliable), Greyhound, and Cape Air out of the Lebanon airport. We encourage participants to post on the [HAMR discussion group][group] to offer or request car rides.
